# Cryptocurrencies

# Project Overview

The purpose of this project is  understand what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. A classification system that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create for this new investment. To group the cryptocurrencies, used a clustering algorithm.


# Resources

* Dataset from LendingClub: [crypto_data.csv]()
* Software: Python 3.9.7, Anaconda Navigator 1.10.0, Conda 4.13.0 and Jupyter Notebooks 6.4.12

# Results

- Total of tradable cryptocurrencies: 532
